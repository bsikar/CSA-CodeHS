What was wrong with the program?
The bug was that when a function was called it returned true when it should have returned false and it returned false when it should have returned true

What expression was the programmer trying to use that gave the error? Relate your answer to De Morganâ€™s Laws.
The programmer was trying to tell if 2 things returned true, but they were using the not operator in the wrong spots
(you dont need to use it)

How did you resolve the error?
I made the code easier to read and didn't try and do funky things with the not opperator
