The instance variables that the Pizza should have are size, toppings, cost, number of pizzas, etc ...
the instance variables repressent what they sound like


Since I am still learning Java I will write a simple thing in rust:

(Rust does not use classes like Java instead it uses impl which is similar)

#[allow(dead_code)]

struct Pizza {
    size: u32,
    toppings: Vec<String>,
    cost: u32,
    num_of_pizzas: u32,
}

impl Pizza {

}

fn main() {
    // ...
}


in Java I think I would do something like:

class Pizza {
    int size;
    Vector<String> toppings;
    numOfPizzas;

    // ...
}
